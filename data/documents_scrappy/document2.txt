Training on Generative AI
AI-Driven Automation
Lead Data Governance Project
We initiated the project by delivering training workshops for the Director team to align them with generative AI technologies. For operational teams, we facilitated hands-on workshops and one-on-one training sessions to support the implementation of AI-driven automation. Key achievements included automating multiple processes across various areas. Additionally, we managed the end-to-end data governance project, from ideation to implementation, which included successfully migrating all user accounts to a Microsoft-based system.
The project delivered excellent results. They saw significant efficiency improvements with manual tasks. This not only saved time but also reduced errors and streamlined our processes. The data governance implementation was seamless, and the feedback from their team has been overwhelmingly positive. They now have a more intelligent, efficient, organized, and secure system. ​
Companies like Promptior offer an agile approach to incorporating Artificial Intelligence. Due to their still-small structure, they can move quickly and are constantly pushing the boundaries of the technological state of the art.
They provide short cycles of trial and error, allowing them to leverage technology to achieve innovative solutions to real and profound problems in a short amount of time.
This type of company brings a new, more agile, and less structured way of working, which can be just as effective as that of more established companies.
